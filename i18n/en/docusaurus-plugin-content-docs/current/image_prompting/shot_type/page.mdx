# 🟢 Shot type

Shot types refer to the various camera angles and compositions used in filmmaking to capture different perspectives and visual effects within a scene. These shot types play a crucial role in conveying the story, setting the mood, and influencing the audience's perception and emotions.

There are several kinds of shot types, which each serve their own unique purpose. Some common examples include long shot, medium shot, bird-eye shot, and low-angle shot.

# Example
