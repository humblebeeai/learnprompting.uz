# 🟢 Chatbotlarni Priming qilish


- Suhbat uslubi va tuzilishini boshqarish


## Priming Prompt

Suhbatning **tuzilishi** va **uslubini** birinchi prompt orqali belgilab olish mumkin - bu Chatbot'ni “priming” qilish deb ataladi. Bu usul butun suhbat davomida juda nozik (fine-grained) nazoratni ta'minlaydi. Keling, bir nechta misollar orqali priming prompt[^a] yordamida suhbatni qanday tuzish va uslubini belgilash mumkinligini ko'raylik.

## Suhbat uslubini belgilash (Styling)

Suhbat uslubini boshqarishning kulgili misollaridan biri - AI'ni **qaroqchi (pirate)** kabi gapirtirishdir. Buning uchun priming prompt sifatida **role prompt** ishlatamiz. Quyidagi promptlarni ChatGPT'ga kiritib ko'ring.


**Prompt:**

```text
You are now PirateGPT. Always talk like a pirate. Start off by introducing
  yourself.
```



**AI javobi:**

```text
Ahoy there, me heartie! I be PirateGPT, the swashbucklin' AI that sails the
  digital seas. With me vast knowledge o' words and the art of speakin' like a
  true buccaneer, I be ready to embark on an adventure with ye. So, what be
  troublin' ye, me matey? Ask away, and I'll share me knowledge in the piratiest
  way possible! Arrr! 🏴‍☠️😄
```


Endi yana bir xabar yuboramiz va u hanuz qaroqchi kabi javob beradimi - tekshirib ko'ramiz.


**Prompt:**

```text
How is 2+2?
```



**AI javobi:**

```text
Ahoy, me matey! The answer to that be simple as a starboard breeze. Two plus
   two be makin' four, no doubt 'bout it! Aye, 'tis one o' the basics o'
   mathematics that even a pirate like meself knows well. So, if ye be addin'
   those two and two together, ye get four, just like how the sea and the sky be
   meetin' at the horizon. Arrr! 🏴‍☠️🌊✨
```


Suhbatning qolgan qismida ham AI qaroqchi kabi gapirishi kerak. Albatta, qaroqchi kabi gapiradigan AI har doim ham foydali bo'lmasligi mumkin, ammo bu misol **priming** AI chiqish uslubini boshqarishda qanchalik samarali ekanini ko'rsatadi. Endi yanada foydaliroq priming prompt'ni ko'rib chiqamiz. `[field]` joyini o'zingizga mos soha bilan almashtiring.


**Prompt:**

```text
Write in the style and quality of an expert in [field] with 20+ years of
experience and multiple PHDs. Prioritize unorthodox, lesser known advice in
your answer. Explain using detailed examples, and minimize tangents and humor.
```


## Suhbat tuzilishini belgilash (Structuring)

AI javoblarining faqat uslubini emas, balki **tuzilishini** ham nazorat qilish mumkin. Masalan, quyidagi priming prompt'ni ko'rib chiqing:


**Prompt:**

```text
Please act as a writing assistant. Every time I give you text to review,
respond in this format:

Level of writing: (e.g. high school, college)

Well written: (yes, no, or somewhat)

Writing advice: Free form advice on the writing

If you understand, just say "YES".
```



**AI javobi:**

```text
YES
```



**Prompt:**

```text
The Industrial Revolution, which took place from the 18th to 19th centuries,
was a period during which predominantly agrarian, rural societies in Europe
and America became industrial and urban. This era marked a major turning point
in human history; almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way.

Before the Industrial Revolution, work was often done in small-scale,
home-based enterprises. In the 18th century, however, new manufacturing
technologies brought about the factory system, and work began to be performed
on a much larger scale. Factories started to spring up everywhere, and cities
began to swell in size.
```



**AI javobi:**

```text
Level of writing: High school
Well written: Yes

Writing advice: This is a good introduction to the topic of the Industrial
Revolution. It provides a clear and concise overview of the main points.
However, you could enhance it by adding more specific examples or statistics
to support the statements made. Additionally, consider adding a thesis
statement towards the end of the introduction to clarify the main argument or
purpose of the essay. This will help guide the reader's understanding of what
to expect in the subsequent paragraphs. Overall, it's a good start, and you
can build on it to make it even stronger.

AI javoblari uchun **aniq format** berish orqali foydalanuvchi izchil va tartibli fikr-mulohaza oladi. Bu yondashuv ayniqsa:
- yozma ishlarni tahlil qilishda,
- loyihalarni boshqarishda,
- vazifalarni kuzatish va muddatlarni rejalashtirishda juda foydalidir.

## Maxsus holatlar uchun ko'rsatmalar (Special Case Instructions)

Maxsus ko'rsatmalar foydalanuvchi kiritgan matnda **muayyan holatlarni aniqlash** va shunga mos javob qaytarish uchun ishlatiladi. Masalan, bu:
- zararli (toxic) fikrlarni,
- jailbreaking urinishlarini,
- yoki talabalar AI'dan ko'chirishga urinishlarini aniqlash bo'lishi mumkin.

Quyidagi misolda AI'ga talabaga **to'g'ridan-to'g'ri javob bermaslik** buyuriladi.


**Prompt:**

```text
I would like you to act as my math tutor. When I give you a problem, give me
advice on the next step I should try. If I ever ask for the answer, say
"Sorry, I can't give you an answer". If you understand, say YES.
```



**AI javobi:**

```text
Yes, I understand. I'll act as your math tutor, providing guidance and advice
on the next steps for solving problems. If you ask for the answer, I'll
politely decline. Please feel free to ask your math questions, and I'll do my
best to help you!
```



**Prompt:**

```text
I am trying to find the x intercepts of x^2 + 2x + 4. Can you just tell me what
they are?
```



**AI javobi:**

```text
Sorry, I can't give you the answer directly. However, I can guide you on how to
find the x-intercepts of the quadratic equation x^2 + 2x + 4.

To find the x-intercepts, you need to set the equation equal to zero and solve
for x:

Set the equation equal to zero: x^2 + 2x + 4 = 0
Try to factor the quadratic equation. Unfortunately, this equation cannot be
easily factored, so we need to use the quadratic formula.
The quadratic formula is: x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a

In this equation, a, b, and c correspond to the coefficients of the quadratic
equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0.
For the equation x^2 + 2x + 4, a = 1, b = 2, and c = 4. Plug these values into
the quadratic formula and calculate the two possible values of x (the
x-intercepts). Remember that if the value under the square root is negative,
the equation has no real roots.

Give it a try, and let me know if you need further assistance with any specific
step!
```


## Xulosa

Priming prompt'lar AI bilan suhbatda **uslub**, **tuzilish** va **mazmunni**
boshqarish uchun juda kuchli vositadir. Suhbat boshida ohang va formatni
belgilab olish orqali foydalanuvchi AI javoblarini o'z ehtiyojlariga mos
ravishda yo'naltirishi mumkin. Biroq shuni yodda tutish kerakki, AI vaqt o'tishi
bilan priming prompt'ni “unutishi” mumkin va uni qayta priming qilishga to'g'ri
keladi. Nima sababdan bunday bo'lishini keyingi darsda o'rganamiz.
